hey, i would love to aknowledge that you are doing great

we are still away from perfection

the @Vector 2.svg is actually behind the canvas which we have created and the data you see about the trancastions is actually inside the range of it

the light plug you see?

should be synced properly as attached in screenshot buddy

the lines should seem to be originated from the light plug source which are 2 and so are the lines

and the containers are the starting points of it

we are super close to perfection and maybe we can nail this done right here, right now

refer the screenshot for final outcome which i want

please rework on the hero page perfectly and replicate the attached screenshot by fixing the lines and containers placement properly

@HeroPage.tsx @hero.css @tailwind.config.js 

we are very close in getting this done buddy 

all we have to do is shift the vector above in right of the your onchain stats thing 

make it float properly on the right if needed 

also press highly in making sure that the data is inside the vector svg

we are very close to perfection
